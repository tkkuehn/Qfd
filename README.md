# Python QFD Structure

This is a python package for working with QFD charts. It's a work in progress.

The motiation for this is that I'm using QFD for a project, and I don't love the idea of using excel to keep track of it. This also gives me the opportunity to get back into good programming practices and python as a whole.

Someday this might include database integration and generation of good looking charts.
